- **Mode**: This is the most important control, as it lets you choose from 20 different reverb algorithms. Each mode has its own sound and behavior, ranging from smooth and natural to chaotic and noisy. You can switch between modes by clicking on the arrows or by using the drop-down menu.
- **Color**: This control lets you adjust the tone color and sonic artifacts of the reverb. You can choose from three options: 1970s, 1980s, and Now. The 1970s color is dark and noisy, with potential for strange and random artifacts. The 1980s color is brighter and cleaner, but still has some character. The Now color is digital, transparent, and colorless.
- **Mix**: This control lets you adjust the balance between the dry and wet signals. You can use it to blend the reverb with your original sound, or to create 100% wet effects.
- **Decay**: This control lets you adjust the decay time of the reverb tail. You can use it to make the reverb shorter or longer, depending on your preference.
- **PreDelay**: This control lets you adjust the delay time between the dry signal and the onset of the reverb. You can use it to create a sense of distance or separation between the source and the reverb.
- **High Cut**: This control lets you adjust the cutoff frequency of a low-pass filter applied to the reverb signal. You can use it to reduce the brightness or harshness of the reverb.
- **Early/Late Mix**: This control lets you adjust the balance between the early reflections and the late reverberation. You can use it to make the reverb more or less dense, or to emphasize certain aspects of the reverb.
- **Size**: This control lets you adjust the apparent size of the reverb space. You can use it to make the reverb smaller or larger, depending on your preference.
- **Depth**: This control lets you adjust the amount of modulation applied to the reverb signal. You can use it to add movement or variation to the reverb, or to create chorus-like effects.
- **Bass/Mid/Treble Mult**: These controls let you adjust the decay time multiplier for different frequency bands. You can use them to shape the frequency response of the reverb tail, or to create frequency-dependent effects.
