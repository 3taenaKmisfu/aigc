I have no idea how the installation process is getting the serial number for the software. I wonder if it is somehow contacting Adobe's servers and verifying the number there. But then, how does Adobe know that I am the one who bought the software and have the right to install it? It never asks me to enter a serial number during the installation. Maybe it uses some kind of unique identifier for my machine to link it to my account.

This is very frustrating because I want to make sure that I am using the software legally and not violating any terms of service. I also want to be able to reinstall the software if I ever need to, without having to worry about losing the serial number or having it rejected by Adobe.
  
I tried to contact Adobe's customer support, but they were not very helpful. They told me to check my email for the confirmation message that I received when I purchased the software online. But I never received such a message, or maybe I deleted it by mistake. They also told me to log in to my Adobe account and check the order history, but there was nothing there either.
  
I don't know what else to do. I feel like I paid for something that I don't really own or have control over. I wish Adobe would make their installation process more transparent and user-friendly. It seems like they are hiding something or trying to trick me into buying more products or services that I don't need.
