If you want to improve your skills and enjoy the game more, here are some tips and tricks for playing Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth:
 
- Use orbital units to support your cities. They can provide various benefits such as clearing miasma, boosting production, or enhancing combat. You can build orbital units from your cities or purchase them with energy. To launch an orbital unit, select it and choose a tile within the orbital layer range of your city. The orbital unit will stay in orbit for a limited number of turns, depending on its type and your affinity level.
- Adapt your technology research to your surroundings. Look for resources and features on the map that can help you grow your civilization, and choose the techs that unlock their improvements. For example, if you have floatstone near your city, you should research terraforming to build floatstone quarries. However, don't neglect the basic techs that provide essential buildings and units.
- Don't provoke the aliens unless you have to. They will usually ignore you unless you attack them or get too close to their nests. You can also improve your relationship with them by researching harmony techs or building alien preserves. If you want to clear a nest, make sure you have enough military units to deal with the alien swarm that will emerge.
- Choose a map with many islands if you want a peaceful start. This will reduce the contact with other civilizations and allow you to focus on your own development. You can also use water tiles to build aquatic cities, which can move around and expand their borders faster than land cities. However, be prepared for naval warfare if you encounter hostile neighbors.
- Get an alien unit early on and use it to explore. Alien units are immune to miasma and can move freely across the map. You can acquire an alien unit by completing an expedition on a skeleton site with an explorer unit. You can also capture an alien unit by using a harmony unit with the xenosanctuary ability.
- Build terrascapes as often as possible. Terrascapes are tile improvements that provide food, production, culture, and energy. They are expensive to maintain, but they are worth it in the long run. You can reduce their maintenance cost by researching ecology or choosing the prosperity virtue tree.
- Use workers to improve water tiles. Unlike in previous Civilization games, you don't need work boats to build improvements on water tiles. You can use regular workers to do so, and they won't be consumed in the process. You can also move workers between land and water tiles with embarkation.
- Purchase units and buildings from the city menu. The production menu no longer has the option to buy things with energy. You have to go to the city menu and click on the item you want to buy. You can also use strategic resources or diplomatic capital to purchase certain units or buildings.
- Use explorers to conduct expeditions on various sites. Expeditions are similar to archaeology in Civilization V, but they are available from the start of the game. You can send explorers to ancient ruins, crashed satellites, alien skeletons, resource pods, or progenitor devices, and they will uncover various rewards such as artifacts, resources, affinity points, or quests.
