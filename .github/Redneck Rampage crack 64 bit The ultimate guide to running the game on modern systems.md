Redneck Rampage is a classic first-person shooter game that was released in 1997 for DOS and Windows 95. The game features hilarious hillbilly humor, crazy weapons, and a lot of action. However, playing Redneck Rampage on modern Windows systems can be tricky, as the game may not run properly or at all with DOSBox or other emulators.
